/**
 * A simple bit sieve used for finding prime number candidates. Allows setting
 * and clearing of bits in a storage array. The size of the sieve is assumed to
 * be constant to reduce overhead. All the bits of a new bitSieve are zero, and
 * bits are removed from it by setting them.
 *
 * To reduce storage space and increase efficiency, no even numbers are
 * represented in the sieve (each bit in the sieve represents an odd number).
 * The relationship between the index of a bit and the number it represents is
 * given by
 * N = offset + (2*index + 1);
 * Where N is the integer represented by a bit in the sieve, offset is some
 * even integer offset indicating where the sieve begins, and index is the
 * index of a bit in the sieve array.
